## About
A free-to-play open-world 2D RPG single-player video game. It revolves around the main character exploring the procedurally generated world and taking advantage of all of the resources the world has to offer. The world is full of monsters that the main character encounters and fights. The character can either destroy the monsters to gain experience from them or capture them to aid in his quest. On top of this, the player can dig ditches, build walls, and place traps to give themselves a leg up on the monsters.
